# P2P_Network

## Description
This project implements a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network using Node.js and TypeScript. It features a centralized Seed node for peer discovery and a Peer node capable of joining the network, discovering neighbors using probabilistic preferential attachment, monitoring neighbor health via consensus, and reporting dead nodes.

## File Structure
* `seed.ts`: The registration server (Seed Node) that maintains the global topology and facilitates peer discovery.
* `peer.ts`: The client node (Peer Node) that connects to the seed to discover others and communicates directly with peers.
* `config.txt`: Contains the IP address and Port Number of the Seed node (format: `IP:Port`).
* `outputfile.txt`: Log file generated by the Seed Node to track peer joins, removals, and network topology changes.
* `package.json`: Project configuration and dependencies.

## How to Run

### 1. Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 18 or higher recommended)
* NPM (installed with Node.js)

### 2. Installation
Open a terminal in the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install


Compilation & Execution
This project uses tsx to run TypeScript files directly without a separate compilation step.

Step A: Configure Seed Address
Edit config.txt to ensure it contains the correct IP and port for the seed node.
Example (config.txt):

Plaintext
127.0.0.1:8080
Step B: Start the Seed Node

Bash
npx tsx seed.ts
Step C: Start Peer Nodes
Open new terminal windows for each peer you wish to start. Run the following command, providing a unique ID, Host IP, and Port for each peer:

Bash
npx tsx peer.ts <unique_id> <host_ip> <port>
Example:

Bash
npx tsx peer.ts peer1 127.0.0.1 5000
npx tsx peer.ts peer2 127.0.0.1 5001
Logs
Seed node activities are logged in outputfile.txt.
